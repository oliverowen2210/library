# library

A library website for the Odin Project's curriculum where you can create 'books'/cards through a form and view them in a grid. 
Currently cards only have descriptions, there's no way to write pages for and open or read one. Maybe in the future?


Learned a lot about DOM manipulation, especially while making the card creation modal and pop-up sidebar, and a bit about constructors while scripting the JS.
